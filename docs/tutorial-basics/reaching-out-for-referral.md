# The Right Approach to Reach Out for a Referral

Hi {"{Name}"}, hope youâ€™re doing well.

I had come across a job position at {"{organisation_name}"} i.e {"{Job_ID}"} (Title) and I feel I would be a great fit for the role as I have __ Years of Experience in __ Domain and I have X, Y, Z Skills that I can bring on to the table.

Job Opening link: {"<Add the link>"}

I would be highly obliged if you can help me with a referral for the same, and it would be highly appreciated if you can put forward my profile to the hiring manager.

I am herewith attaching my resume for your kind perusal, looking forward to hearing from you.

Regards,  
ABC

***Note: Do not forget to attach your resume!***
