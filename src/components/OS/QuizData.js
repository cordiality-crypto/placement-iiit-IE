      text: `Q1) A company's primary application, hosted in North America, uses a stateful monolithic architecture. Due to global expansion, there is a significant increase in traffic from Europe, European users report latency issues. After analysis, the majority of latency arises during the user authentication phase. A microservice in Europe just for authentication will be implemented.
It must ensure that:
-User data remains consistent between North America and Europe.
-Sensitive user information, such as passwords, remains encrypted and is not directly transferred across regions.
-The latency during the authentication phase for European users is minimized.

Given these constraints, which approach best addresses the issues?

      text: `Q3) Consider a complex multi-threaded Linux application that utilizes POSIX threads for parallel processing. The application has multiple threads executing concurrently, each accessing shared resources. One of the threads needs to perform a critical section of code protected by a mutex to ensure proper synchronization and prevent data corruption. However, the following challenges are there:
1. The thread that holds the mutex enters a non-preemptive state and cannot be forcibly preempted by the scheduler.
2. There is a real-time thread with higher priority that requires access to the same critical section protected by the mutex.
3. The real-time thread needs to be granted access to the critical section within a fixed time frame, or it might cause a system failure.

Which of the following statements is true?
