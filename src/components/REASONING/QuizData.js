    text: `Q1) In a circuit, four switches labeled A, B, C, and D are connected to a logic gate arrangement to control a single output light. The switches can be either in the ON (1) or OFF (0) position. The logic circuit is defined as follows:
1. Switches A and B are inputs to an AND gate.
2. Switches C and D are inputs to an OR gate.
3. The outputs of both the AND and the OR gates are then input to an XOR (exclusive OR) gate, which controls the output light.
Which combination of switch positions (ON=1, OFF=0) will turn the output light ON?`,
